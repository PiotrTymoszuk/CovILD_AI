1) work on explanations for the table with hyperparameter tuning: the hyperparameters need to be explained

2) add explanations of the hyperparameters in Supplementary Methods; stress how they were found (repeated cross-validation)

3) Supplementary Methods for the learning curves, network analyses, and bootstrap tests for correlations and comparisons
